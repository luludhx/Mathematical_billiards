# Mathematical-billiards
Computing assignment in third year of physics msci. 
In this project the ”classical” mathematical game of billiards is investigated. Mathematical billiards are an idealization of the billiard game, in which a point mass moves in a straight line and collides elastically with a boundary. We investigate the square, the circle, the ellipse, the Bunimovich stadium and the half stadium (and the bunny). The first three systems are integrable, while the last two (three) are chaotic. The chaos is characterized by the Lyapunov exponents.
Repository includes a project report and individual .py files for differently shaped billiards.
